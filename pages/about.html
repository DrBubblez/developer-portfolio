                    My name is Harrison Miner, and I'm a software developer specializing in front-end development. 
                    After taking a leap of faith and completing a full-stack web development boot camp at the University of Central Florida, 
                    I quickly became fascinated by the field of software development. Born in 2001, I've grown up alongside the modern internet, 
                    watching it evolve into what it is today. I've always had a curiosity about technology hardware and how it functions, but 
                    discovering the expansive world of software was eye-opening.
                    <br><br>
                    My current goal is to secure a full-time role as a front-end developer, allowing me to continually refine my skills and eventually 
                    grow into a full-stack developer. I approach every project intending to become more efficient, write cleaner code, and challenge 
                    myself to learn new tools. For instance, while building this portfolio site, I chose to learn Tailwind CSS to enhance my design 
                    capabilities and create a cleaner look compared to my previous projects.
                    <br><br>
                    Outside of technology, I have diverse interests, including gardening and cultivating bonsai trees. I also take pride in caring 
                    for my pets and creating enjoyable environments for them. My involvement in Boy Scouts and childhood RV trips nurtured a deep 
                    appreciation for the outdoors. These varied interests and experiences have shaped me into the person I am today.
