# Harrison Miner - Developer Portfolio

## Overview
Welcome to my portfolio website project. This website is more than just a showcase—it’s a place where I share who I am, how I grew, and the tools I've discovered along the way.

I set out to build something modern, responsive, and visually engaging. Along the journey, I challenged myself to learn Tailwind CSS. That choice opened the door to other new tools like Vite and Anime.js. These are skills I plan to carry into my next, more dynamic portfolio project.

This site doesn’t just represent what I know today. It marks a moment in my path—one where learning, experimentation, and creative expression intersect. My next goal? To build a more dynamic portfolio that reflects even deeper growth.

Thanks for stopping by. I hope you see both the work and the story behind it.
